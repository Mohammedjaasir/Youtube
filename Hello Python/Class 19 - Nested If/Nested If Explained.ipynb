    "# Conditionals - Nested If\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested if statements allow you to place an `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement inside another `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement. This is called nesting in programming. You can nest any number of these statements inside one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if expression1:\n",
    "    if expression2:\n",
    "        # code block\n",
    "    elif expression3:\n",
    "        if expression4:\n",
    "            # code block\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            if expression5:\n",
    "                # code block\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # code block\n",

    "In this example, the first `if` statement checks if `x` is greater than 5. If it is, the program prints 'x is greater than 5' and then evaluates the nested `if` statement, which checks if `y` is greater than 15. Based on the evaluation, it prints the appropriate message."
