    "# Introduction to Iteration & While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration is the concept of looping through a block of code multiple times. Python provides two popular loops for iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `while` loop\n",
    "2. The `for` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Python does not provide a `do while` loop."

    "## The `while` Loop\n",

    "A `while` loop in Python repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true. The syntax of a `while` loop is:\n",
